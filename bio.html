        <h2>
          Growing up as an only child, I became very creative in order to keep
          myself entertained and excited. Drawing on the walls of the house and
          play coloring with pens and brushes, then grew this behavior to
          determine my future as an artist. Whether it was this that spurred my
          love for art, I am not sure; however, it was the beginning of my
          journey through the realms of art and design. / / / My career
          aspirations led me to the School Visual Arts, where I was encouraged
          to enroll in the Graphic Design program. I was also the recipient of
          the Honorable Mention Award, given to students who exhibit outstanding
          achievement in the areas of academic achievement, leadership, and
          perseverance. During an internship, I learned the fundamentals of
          building and designing websites, and when I graduated, I started work
          at a trend forecasting company in New York City. Eventually, I decided
          that I wanted to continue my education and moved to San Francisco. I
          studied fine art and painting with a full scholarship at the San
          Francisco Art Institute. / / / With college and university wrapped up,
          and ten years of industry experience under my belt, I went freelance
          at the end of 2017. My focus lately has been helping small businesses
          get started on the internet by designing and building websites that
          are professional and clean, with a content-management system for their
          website that allows them to take control of their brand’s narrative.
          Although I worked mainly as a web designer, once my clients realized
          that my formal training was in graphic design, it allowed me also to
          offer those services. Along the way, I noticed that I have a passion
          for understanding people and their needs and then coming to real
          solutions for those people based on that understanding. / / / Building
          a career in UX design for me has been a lifelong journey full of
          meaningful pit stops that have equipped me to be a thoughtful,
          empathetic, and analytical user advocate. UX design is the perfect
          marriage of my passion for technology and my talent for empathizing
          with people and producing real solutions for them. Making a career
          change takes serious commitment, and therefore I enrolled in Bloc's UX
          Design Apprenticeship program. I learned what it meant to be a problem
          solver and how to refocus the different skills and talents I had
          previously accrued over the years into a process that produces
          user-centered products. Good design is much more than pretty things;
          it is a beautiful conversation rooted in a deep understanding of the
          people you are creating solutions for.
