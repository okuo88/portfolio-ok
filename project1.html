      <h1><strong>What is Cube Cloud?</strong></h1>
      <h4>
        <h7>For</h7> my first project as a UX Design Apprentice at
        <a class="bloc" href="https://www.bloc.io/" style="color:blue">Bloc</a>
        , I was tasked to design a cloud storage application and brand that
        would rethink the cloud storage market by targeting the problems people
        face today. According to the report, the group of people over sixty is
        growing more rapidly than any other demographic. As the population ages,
        though, more “seniors” will be comfortable with technology and only need
        compensation for actual physiological and cognitive changes. We need to
        understand these changes in order to effectively master interface design
        for older adults. I designed Cube Cloud specifically, for this reason,
        to serve as a new kind of workspace that helps users of all ages animate
        their ideas seamlessly and share them with a robust community.

      <!-- Problem Solving -->
      <h1><strong>Problem Solving</strong></h1>
      <h2><mark>CHAPTER #1 — Problems and Solutions</mark></h2>
      <h4>
        For this project, I was challenged to rethink cloud storage by targeting
        real-world problems that the competition hadn’t yet addressed. At first,
        I thought that users wanted a more intuitive, easily navigable
        dashboard, but my research proved that they wanted much more than that.
        Designers should make additional compensations for older adults in
        applications specifically geared toward them, —things like larger fonts,
        more intuitive interface elements, clear wording, and helpful tips for
        functionality—it will only improve their user experience.
      </h4>
      <img class="ivisual" src="images/visual.png" alt="visual" />
      <h3>Visual Elements for Users with Impaired Senses</h3>
      <h4>
        Vision loss is the most common disability reported in adults in the
        United States. Many older adults use reading glasses or opt for much
        larger font sizes when given the option. Text and button sizes should be
        kept large. Basically, anything that’s meant to be read or clicked
        should be scaled up.
      </h4>
      <img class="icons" src="images/interaction.png" alt="interaction" />
      <h3>Improving Interaction for Older Adults</h3>
      <h4>
        Interaction is fundamental to the user experience. Visual cues are often
        vital to those interactions. For older adults, especially, visual cues
        need to be clear, easy to decipher, and easy to interact with. But it
        goes beyond just making sure visual cues are clear. Every part of the
        interaction needs to be kept easy to understand and complete.
      </h4>
      <img class="interaction" src="images/cc3.png" alt="cc3" />
      <h6>
        Larger buttons and other clickable targets are important for senior
        users.
      </h6>
      <img class="ibrain" src="images/brain.png" alt="brain" />
      <h3>Issues with Memory and Concentration</h3>
      <h4>
        Older adults need a bit more time to absorb the information they’re
        presented with and take appropriate action. Where this becomes a real
        problem is when presented with complex tasks that require quick intake
        and processing of information in order to make decisions. Minimalist
        design—can help prevent cognitive overload from slower mental processing
        speeds in older adults. Designers should also ensure that older people’s
        attention isn’t being divided by multiple tasks or parts of a screen.
      </h4>
      <img class="icons" src="images/motivation.png" alt="motivation" />
      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <h4>
        While younger generations often integrate technology seamlessly into
        their lives, older adults use technology a bit differently. Applications
        that aren’t useful are generally neglected by seniors. If an older adult
        doesn’t find an application to be useful, they’re likely to ignore it
        for days, weeks, or even months. However, if they see the benefits of
        using an app, they’ll be motivated to use it regularly.

      <h4>
        In order to understand how I arrived at the solutions to the problems at
        hand, I had to go back to the beginning — starting with user research.
        What were my users’ top frustrations and what did they want the most
        from cloud storage? I’d had a hunch, but to really know the answers to
        these questions, I had to turn to the responses gathered from my user
        research survey targeting existing cloud storage senior users creating
        and sharing on a frequent basis.
      </h4>
      <img class="research" src="images/cc4.png" alt="cc4" />
      <h4>
        My initial assumptions were that users wanted an overhaul to the user
        experience. But what I’d found to be most informative from this survey
        was the desire for additional community, collaboration and saving
        features that would enhance user creativity.
      </h4>
      <img class="icons" src="images/users.png" alt="users" />
      <h3>Understanding the users</h3>
      <br />
      <h4>
        According to my survey, there were two types of people using cloud
        storage apps:<br /><br />

        <strong>1.</strong> People who want to create and store information in a
        well-organized manner<br /><br />

        <strong>2.</strong> People who want to ideate, create content, get
        feedback, and/or save content for new ideas and inspiration<br /><br />

        <strong>3.</strong> People who want to get in sync with their friends
        and family
      </h4>
      <h4>
        I’d found that these survey respondents best aligned with my primary
        audience as they were the big curious-minded thinkers and doers. They
        were the designers, freelancers, illustrators, etc. between the ages of
        30–55 in the creative tech industries who were constantly brainstorming
        and seeking perspective from industry professionals.

        Three of the main suppliers are Google Drive, Dropbox, and Box. They
        give similar basic features and are very comparable. Dropbox has been
        available many years before Google Drive so it has a bigger piece of the
        overall industry, anyway Google Drive still is a nearby contender.
        Lastly, Box places a strong emphasis on security, especially as it
        pertains to collaboration. There are different approaches to file
        management that pose unique challenges to each vendor. Platforms and
        pricing, security and administrative control and collaboration.

      <h3>User Personas</h3>
      <h4>
        Personas are helpful throughout the entire product development phase:
        from deciding on which features to have in a prototype, to evaluating
        the end product. When combined with additional user experiences design
        methods, such as usability testing and task analyses, personas are vital
        to launching a useful and usable solution. Enter Marianne and Gladys,
        two vastly different personas to embody the full range of Cube Cloud’s
        target audience.

      <h3>Designing the logo</h3>
      <h4>
        After selecting the brand name, the logo underwent a plethora of sketch
        iterations before arriving at its final design. I began the brainstorm
        by using a mind-mapping exercise to curate a concept that communicated
        the formation of an idea when many people come together.

      <img class="logosketch" src="images/cc6.png" alt="cc6" />
      <h4>
        To maintain consistency with the Mathematical theme, I focused on using
        square and boxes planetary shapes. Why the blue logo? “Blue is
        associated with the sky and the ocean, which both evoke feelings of
        tranquility and security.” According to the “Color Associations” report,
        Blue got the most votes for trust, security, and reliability and
        finished second in high quality and high technology.

        The best way I’ve found to quickly, easily, and comprehensively
        communicate with is to share sketches and user flows throughout the
        whole project. Not only does this help me articulate how I plan to
        tackle a problem, but by thinking out loud on paper, it allows
        everyone—myself, designers, or even clients—to see how ideas begin,
        evolve, and finally crystallize into the solution we’ve all been working
        toward.

      <h4>
        Referring back to the problem objectives, I knew I had to address the
        issue of low discoverability in cloud storage interfaces. Because of
        this, I chose to display top-level navigation to promote exploration and
        allows users to easily access the broad categories within the primary
        navigation before drilling down more specific pages. This top-level
        approach eliminated unnecessary clicking and the reliance on the search
        box to find files.

      <h3>Round 1: Testing the wireframe prototype</h3>
      <h4>
        If I had moved onto wireframe testing at this point in the process I
        would have overlooked some of the most glaring issues living within my
        wireframes. Before moving onto high fidelity mockups, I needed to
        validate my design decisions through testing. To do this, I used Maze to
        test mission-based tasks and InVision to conduct in-person usability
        tests using a wireframe clickable prototype and a
        <a

        Seniors (ages 55 and older) are one of the fastest-growing demographics
        on the web. However, lots of usability studies show that many websites
        and apps are hard to use for seniors. For example, UI elements like
        dropdowns and sliders are more difficult for users with declining motor
        skills, particularly on touch interfaces. Older adults don’t need a ton
        of compensation to feel comfortable using an application. Following best
        practices and usability guidelines, in general, will go a long way
        toward making products accessible to all users, regardless of age or any
        physical or cognitive impairments.

        For this project, I think about the problems people encounter in
        everyday life and how a simple app product could solve those problems.
        Design a simple onboarding flow, as well as the in-app screens and user
        dashboard. What worked in this project? User flows, page layout, and
        visual design. User flows help determine how many screens are needed,
        what order they should appear in, and what components need to be
        present. This should lead to better user experiences as it places the
        user at the heart of the design process. What didn’t? Navigation
        considerations for the elderly, are our biggest challenge. First of all,
        they don’t understand what “cloud storage” and what is for and what does
        it do or help. What were my doubts about going into the project? My

        want all ages to use my app. But the target audience can not be
        “everyone.” The more clearly I define my target group, the better I can
        understand how and where to reach my best prospects. I can’t target
        everyone, but I can sell to everyone. What surprised me the most? I
        think the most basic definition of surprise and delight is designing for
        moments. It’s about establishing an emotional connection with your users
        and reminding them that the product they’re interacting with is human.
        What would I have done differently if given more time? None, I’m very
        confident in my design and app. What did I learn while doing this
        project? 3 things I learned from doing my project. To successfully
        design something that solves users’ problems and meets their needs, UX
        professionals must be able to get out of their own heads, interact with
        a cross-section of users, empathize with them, and apply what they’ve
        shared to the product development process.<br />
      </h4>
      <p>
        <b>⦁ Empathy:</b> Put the users in front of everyone! Personas and
        empathy maps are one way to deeply understand user needs.<br />
        <b>⦁ Alignment:</b> The research findings are very important. The users
        and their pain points need to be considered when making any
        decisions.<br />
        <b>⦁ Iteration:</b> Anything that is deve loped from scratch will be an
        assumption. It’s essential to keep iterating to understand the users and
        their needs while they evolve. If a test fails, test again.

      <h3>Conclusion: Looking back and beyond</h3>
      <h4>
        Creating this application challenged me to learn the importance of
        understanding user objectives. Instead of amplifying existing features
        and enhancing dashboard navigability within cloud storage, I had to
        restructure my approach to identify 1) the goals of my target audience,
        2) the steps users were undergoing to meet those goals, 3) a solution
        that would optimize their current process. My problem objective of
        solely enhancing the discoverability of existing cloud storage products
        had immediately shifted when I found that users also wanted to improve
        their creative processes by exposing their work to a community of
        creative people. This realization was the key turning point that I
        wasn’t expecting. In addition to this, I also learned the importance of
        user testing as early and as often as possible. If I could give my
        former self one piece of advice, it would be to design less user flows
        early on in the design process so that I could spend that time focusing
        on testing just a few primary flows. You can design a solution as
        meticulously as possible, but there’s nothing quite like experiencing
        your users frustratingly fail at accomplishing tasks or insightfully
        delight at a key interaction to reiterate the importance and
        inevitability of testing. If I had more time, I would integrate three
        key features — notes, chat and advanced search capabilities to allow
        users to create more types of content quickly, engage even further with
        their community, and find information through visual and suggested
        search terms. Finally, designing this solution taught me so much about
        people, their expectations, and how small changes to even smaller
        interactions matter. I learned how to empathize and understand the
        impact that a product can have on a person’s mood when you focus on
        solving their problems. And in return, it’s amazing how helping my users
        gleaned a new, humbling perspective on my own goal — designing products
        that positively impact and serve the greater good. I came to the
        conclusion that if I can set out to help a person come up with an idea
        that has the potential to make a tiny fragment of our world a better
        place, then I have set out to help accomplish something magical and
        momentous indeed.
