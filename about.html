        <strong>Growing up as an only child,</strong> I became very creative in
        order to keep myself entertained and excited. Drawing on the walls of
        the house and play coloring with pens and brushes, then grew this
        behavior to determine my future as an artist. Whether it was this that
        spurred my love for art, I am not sure; however, it was the beginning of
        my journey through the realms of art and design.<br /><br />
        / / /<br /><br />
        My career aspirations led me to the School Visual Arts, where I was
        encouraged to enroll in the Graphic Design program. I was also the
        recipient of the Honorable Mention Award, given to students who exhibit
        outstanding achievement in the areas of academic achievement,
        leadership, and perseverance. During an internship, I learned the
        fundamentals of building and designing websites, and when I graduated, I
        started work at a trend forecasting company in New York City.
        Eventually, I decided that I wanted to continue my education and moved
        to San Francisco. I studied fine art and painting with a full
        scholarship at the San Francisco Art Institute. <br /><br />
        / / / <br /><br />With college and university wrapped up, and ten years
        of industry experience under my belt, I went freelance at the end of
        2017. My focus lately has been helping small businesses get started on
        the internet by designing and building websites that are professional
        and clean, with a content-management system for their website that
        allows them to take control of their brand’s narrative. Although I
        worked mainly as a web designer, once my clients realized that my formal
        training was in graphic design, it allowed me also to offer those
        services. Along the way, I noticed that I have a passion for
        understanding people and their needs and then coming to real solutions
        for those people based on that understanding.<br /><br />
        / / /<br /><br />
        Building a career in UX design for me has been a lifelong journey full
        of meaningful pit stops that have equipped me to be a thoughtful,
        empathetic, and analytical user advocate. UX design is the perfect
        marriage of my passion for technology and my talent for empathizing with
        people and producing real solutions for them. Making a career change
        takes serious commitment, and therefore I enrolled in Bloc's UX Design
        Apprenticeship program. I learned what it meant to be a problem solver
        and how to refocus the different skills and talents I had previously
        accrued over the years into a process that produces user-centered
        products. Good design is much more than pretty things; it is a beautiful
        conversation rooted in a deep understanding of the people you are
        creating solutions for.
